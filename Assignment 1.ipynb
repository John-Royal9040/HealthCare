    "Despite the availability of Medicaid and other publicly funded healthcare benefits, individuals experiencing homelessness in urban environments—particularly in Baltimore, Maryland—continue to face significant barriers to healthcare utilization. Existing research suggests that education levels, income disparities, and health literacy play critical roles in shaping access to and engagement with healthcare services. However, the persistence of underutilization despite formal accessibility indicates the presence of deeper structural, socioeconomic, and psychological barriers. Systemic factors such as bureaucratic complexity, distrust in medical institutions, mental health challenges, and logistical constraints (e.g., lack of transportation, unstable living conditions) further exacerbate healthcare disparities among this vulnerable population.\n",

    "This study aims to investigate the interplay between educational attainment, income levels, and health awareness in influencing Medicaid and healthcare benefit utilization among homeless individuals in Baltimore. Additionally, it seeks to identify the underlying factors that contribute to persistent non-engagement with available healthcare resources. By critically analyzing these barriers, this research will provide evidence-based insights to inform policy interventions that can enhance healthcare accessibility, improve program efficacy, and ultimately bridge the gap between healthcare availability and utilization among urban homeless populations."

By analyzing enrollment trends, disparities, and demographic patterns, this data will help assess how education, income, and awareness impact Medicaid usage among urban homeless populations in Baltimore, Maryland. Additionally, it will aid in identifying factors contributing to the underutilization of available healthcare programs despite accessibility, aligning directly with the research question’s focus on social determinants of healthcare utilization.\n",

    "Beyond analyzing Medicaid utilization among Baltimore’s urban homeless population, this dataset also provides a national perspective on healthcare enrollment trends across different racial and ethnic groups. By comparing Baltimore-specific data to national figures, this research can uncover broader patterns of healthcare accessibility and disparities. This comparative approach allows for inferences about whether the challenges faced in Baltimore reflect national trends or are uniquely influenced by local socioeconomic factors. Leveraging this dataset enables a deeper understanding of systemic barriers to healthcare, informing policy recommendations that could improve Medicaid outreach and effectiveness on both local and national scales."
